              The difference between local storage and session storage is that
              the stored data on local storage don't get deleted when we close
              the browser.Session storage data gets stored only for the session
              and gets deleted when browser is closed. Local storage is useful
              for storing data that you want to persist even after closing the
              browser. On the other hand, session storage is useful for storing
              data that is sensitive.

              The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets
              are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope
              means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that
              program, any function or conditional state can access that
              variable. On the other hand, Block scope is a sub-type of local
              scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
              variables inside the curly brackets {}.You are only allowed to
              refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

              The event loop is the secret behind JavaScriptâ€™s asynchronous
              programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but
              using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of
              multi-threading. The call stack is responsible for keeping track
              of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function
              is finished, it is popped from the stack. The event queue is
              responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing.
              Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API.
              Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts
              its own single-threaded operation. Event loop constantly checks
              whether or not the call stack is empty. If it is empty, new
              functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the
              current function call is processed.

              There are eight ways to get undefined. Some of them are: Declaring
              a variable without assigning a value to it, implicit return of
              function due to missing return statement, return statement which
              do not return anything, look up of non existing property in an
              object, function parameter that have not passed, anything that has
              been set to the value of undefined.
